#Implementation of A* search#

TO RUN CODE: python Assingment2.py World1.txt h

Here h is the heuristic type, h = 1 for manhattan and h = 2 for straight distance to goal

The program outputs the path from the horse(7,0) to the apples(0,9), the total cost of the path, and the total ammount of locations evaluated. See writeup.pdf for details.

##How to read the coordinates##

* The x coordinates start from 0 at the top to 7 at the bottom of the maze.
* The y coordinates start from 0 at the left to 9 at the right of the maze.
